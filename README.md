# 👋 Hi, I’m Gaetano, aka RiuHz out here!
Something about me, i'm a student of Computer Science, my love to code started from my adorable mom ❤️ when she saw i enjoyed playing a lot of videogames as a child (i still do ^^ and you can find me with the name of Riu/RiuHz) and she told me to go study Computer Science because of that, turns out it's a lot of fun and makes you express your creativity in so many ways!
<!---at Federico II University--->

# 🎓 I’m currently learning Python and AI
My studies are pretty much focused on Python and simple AI, you can find one of my projects [here](https://express.adobe.com/it-IT/sp/design/page/urn:aaid:sc:EU:107fce2b-d0e3-4074-96da-c3d9a1eacb40/preview) (the whole project and thesis is in italian), and if you are wondering why my GitHub profile has no repositories the answer is easy! _I still have no projects that i'm willing to show as a student, but i promise i will show some of the coding i do in my studies and free time_.
Where are my studies taking me? On a Data Scientist path, it's a long journey but i have to start somewhere.

# 💻 Technologies
Here is a list of technologies and tools i know and use within my studies. <br>

# 🎮 My hobbies
I play a lot of videogames and can say i enjoy playing with friends doesn't matter which game it is but i prefer cooperative games of every genre, oh and from time to time i play tabletop games and i'm a Game Master on a D&D 5e campaign trying to kill all my lovely players but they don't know it so keep the secret 🤫.

# What else can i say?
```python
class Student:

  def __init__(self):
    self.name = "Gaetano"
    self.major = "Computer Science"
    self.language = ["it_IT", "en_US"]
    
  def say_bye(self):
    print('Thanks for reading!')
    
Riu = Student()
Riu.say_bye()
